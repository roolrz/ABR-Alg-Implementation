# Sabre

Sabre is an open-source simulation environment for ABR algorithms. It is a Python tool that facilitates initial development and quick evaluation of algorithms in an environment similar to real production players, without requiring the algorithm researchers to learn the often complex implementation details of a production player. Sabre takes a video description, network trace, and an ABR algorithm as inputs and gives a collection of QoE metrics as output.
